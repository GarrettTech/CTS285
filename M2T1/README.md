# M2T1 - webapp #1

goals:
 - to learn basics Flask programming 
 - to be able to repeat a server config
 - maybe to have fun

 ## lessons learned
bash commands you cannot live without:
- ls <- whats in this directory 
- cd <- change the directory 
- source <- run a script (like activate)


 ## instructions 
 initial tutorial: https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/121/
 but we're using codespaces instead of PA
 
 install library:

 first set up virtualenvironment
 - pip install virtualenv
 - virtualenv venv
 - source venv/bin/activate
 now we have our "venv" environment, so we can install things in it.
 
 to turn it off:
 - source venv/bin/deactivate (deactivate to shut it off)

start installing requirments:
 - pip install flask
 - pip freeze > requirements.txt
